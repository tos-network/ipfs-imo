IPFS-Imo is an embeddable, lightweight IPFS peer which runs the minimal setup
to provide an `ipld.DAGService` and UnixFS-files addition and retrieval.

The goal of IPFS-Imo is to provide decentralized storage services and edge computing for smart contract bytecode files and transaction processing for the tos-network, while earning token rewards.
